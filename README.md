# radioCLI
Listen to your favorite radio stations in the terminal with this python script.

# How to use 
This script needs 'mpv' as a dependency but you can change that to your favorite terminal based player simply by changing line 32.

The 'stations.json' file contains all the necessary metadata for the radio stations included by defaults, there is the possibility for adding your own
personal stations.
